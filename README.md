[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/4dmqta7pnueqxa11?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/shanec-/generator-nullfactory-xrm)
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/generator-nullfactory-xrm.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/generator-nullfactory-xrm)

A yeoman generator for scaffolding [Solution Packager](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj602987.aspx)-compatible Dynamics 365 project structures.

The project structure is built around the Solution Packager (provided as part of the official SDK) and the [Microsoft.Xrm.Data.PowerShell](https://github.com/seanmcne/Microsoft.Xrm.Data.PowerShell) module. It facilitates the quick creation of team builds and release strategies with minimal effort and enables you to maintain a single source of truth for your CRM solutions.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-nullfactory-xrm using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-nullfactory-xrm
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo nullfactory-xrm
```

## Execution

Template questions and their purpose:

1. Visual Studio solution (*.sln) filename?  `The visual studio solution filename.`
2. Visual Studio project prefix?  `The prefix for the projects generated. This can be an organization name or preferred convention.`
3. Source CRM server url? `This is the source CRM server url. Example:[https://sndbx.crm6.dynamics.com](https://sndbx.crm6.dynamics.com)`
4. Source CRM solution name? `The name of the CRM solution to be extracted.`
5. Add *.WebResource project? `Specifies if a new project should be created to manage the web resouces.`
6. Add *.Plugin project? `Specifies if a new plugin project should be created.`
7. Add *.Workflow project? `Specifies if a new workflow project should be created`

## Post Installation Setup

Start off by running the `_RunFirst.ps1` powershell script located in the generated root folder. This script would restore and update the packages used by the `Nullfactory.Xrm.Tooling`

```
.\_RunFirst.ps1
```

Next, if you opted to add either a plugin or workflow project, ensure that the assembly is signed with a new key.  

Optionally, install the [`Microsoft.Xrm.Data.PowerShell`](https://github.com/seanmcne/Microsoft.Xrm.Data.PowerShell) powershell module. On a Windows 10 or later, do this by executing the included powershell script `Nullfactory.Xrm.Tooling\_Install\Install-Microsoft.Xrm.Data.PowerShell.ps1` or manually running the following command:

```
Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Xrm.Data.PowerShell -Scope CurrentUser -Force
```

Even if you skip this step, the sychrnoization PowerShell script would attempt to install it automatically. The PowerShell scripts require a minimum of PowerShell 5.0 and Microsoft.Xrm.Data.PowerShell 2.5.

### Install Customised .gitignore

If the underlying repository is git, run the following command to install a customised version of the gitignore file. This file is structured to include the binaries within the `Nullfactory.Xrm.Tooling\bin\coretools` folder.  

```
yo nullfactory-xrm:gitignore
```

## Pull the CRM Solution into the Project Structure

Anytime the CRM solution needs to be pulled down into the project structure, execute the script located at `Nullfactory.Xrm.Tooling\Scripts\Pull-CrmSolution.Param.ps1`.

### Resource Mapping

Edit the mapping file to map to the appropriate resource project. They are located in the `Nullfactory.Xrm.Tooling\Mapping` folder. 
More information on the structure of the mapping file can be found [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj602987.aspx#use_command)

## Building the CRM Solution

The repackaging the extracted solution is integrated as a post-build step of the solution class library. Simply build it to output both a managed as well as unmanaged CRM solution package. 

### Install a YAML based CI Build

Use the following command and prompts in order to generate a tailored YAML CI build file.

```
yo nullfactory-xrm:cibuild
```

Currently supports only [Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/actions/build-yaml).
